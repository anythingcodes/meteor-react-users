# meteor-react-users

**[Demo](https://meteor-react-users.herokuapp.com)**

A React, Meteor, and node single-page app that fetches data from a MongoDB instance of Faker users. Uses publishing and subscriptions to load subsets of database data (using the 'Load More' button). Built mostly to get acquainted with Meteor for the first time.

## Instructions

Navigate to the `meteorReactSPA/app` folder in the command line. Make sure you have node installed on your machine, then run `npm i` to install node modules. Make sure you have Meteor installed on your machine, then run `meteor` from that directory. You will be given the app's URL.
